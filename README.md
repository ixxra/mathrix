##Testing matrix manipulation with javascript

###Welcome to the MathriX.
This is an example app of what can be done with math.js. It is far from complete, we aim to develop a mobile friendly user interface to make elemental row operations in matrices.

Also, have a look at [mathnotepad](http://mathnotepad.com/).

Have Fun!
