##Testing matrix manipulation with javascript

##Welcome
Here you can find a webapp for pivoting matrices. 
It aim to help students learning linear algebra, or operations research with the tedious maths of doing gaussian elimination.

You can test it at [http://ixxra.github.io/mathrix/apps/opResearch/simplePivoting](http://ixxra.github.io/mathrix/apps/opResearch/simplePivoting)

Feel free to modify.



##Old Welcome Message
###Welcome to the MathriX.
This is an example app of what can be done with math.js. It is far from complete, we aim to develop a mobile friendly user interface to make elemental row operations in matrices.

Also, have a look at [mathnotepad](http://mathnotepad.com/).

Have Fun!
